# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the price of a specific well-known cryptocurrency (in USD) using its historical price data. By applying time series analysis and machine learning techniques, we seek to build a model capable of forecasting future price movements.

## Dataset

-   **Source**: Provided dataset for a specific task/competition.
-   **Description**: The dataset contains historical price data for a single, popular cryptocurrency in USD.
-   **Data Files**:
    -   `train.csv`: The training set, containing 6,000 historical price records.
    -   `test.csv`: The test set, containing 4,000 records for which prices need to be predicted.
    -   `sample_submission.csv`: A sample file demonstrating the correct submission format.
-   **Columns**:
    -   `id`: A sequential identifier for each record.
    -   `price`: The price of the cryptocurrency in USD (this is the target variable to be predicted).
-   **File Format**: CSV

## Methods Used

### 1. **Time Series Analysis & Supervised Learning: Price Prediction**
    -   **Potential Models**:
        -   Classical Time Series Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.
        -   Machine Learning Regression Models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).
        -   Deep Learning Models: Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs, GRUs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs for time series), Transformer-based models.
        -   Specialized Time Series Forecasting Libraries: Facebook Prophet.
    -   **Objective**: To predict the future `price` of the cryptocurrency.
    -   **Data Preprocessing**:
        -   Handling missing values (if any).
        -   Feature scaling/normalization (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler).
        -   Time series specific transformations: checking for stationarity, differencing.
        -   Creating sequences/windows of past prices to predict future prices (especially for RNNs/LSTMs).
    -   **Feature Engineering (if applicable beyond just 'price')**:
        -   Lagged features (using past prices to predict future ones).
        -   Rolling statistics (e.g., moving averages, rolling standard deviation of the price).
        -   Date-time features (if timestamps were available and extracted, though not explicitly mentioned in the columns).
    -   **Evaluation Metrics**:
        -   Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        -   Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        -   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
        -   Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
        -   R-squared (RÂ²)
    -   **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, prophet, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    -   **Objective**: Understand price trends, volatility, and other characteristics of the time series.
    -   **Techniques**:
        -   Time series plots of the `price`.
        -   Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to identify potential model orders for ARIMA-like models or to understand dependencies.
        -   Distribution plots of price changes/returns.
    -   **Libraries**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_link>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment & Install Dependencies**:
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure `requirements.txt` lists all necessary packages like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras, etc., based on the methods used in your notebook.)*

3.  **Data Loading**:
    -   Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in a designated `data/` directory or ensure they are in the root.
    -   Load data using `pandas`:
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
        test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
        ```

4.  **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**:
    -   Execute the preprocessing steps as defined in your `Cryptocurrency Price Prediction.ipynb` notebook. This will likely involve scaling the `price` data and creating sequences if using neural networks.

5.  **Model Training**:
    -   Split the `train_df` data into training and validation sets (ensuring chronological order for time series data).
    -   Initialize and train your chosen model(s).
    -   Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

6.  **Model Evaluation**:
    -   Evaluate the model on the validation set using metrics like RMSE, MAE.
    -   Visualize predictions against actual values from the validation set.

7.  **Prediction & Submission**:
    -   Preprocess the `test.csv` data in the same way as the training data.
    -   Use the trained model to predict the `price` for the test set.
    -   Format the predictions according to `sample_submission.csv` (typically `id` and predicted `price`).
    -   Save the submission file:
        ```python
        # Example for creating a submission file
        # predictions = model.predict(processed_test_data)
        # submission_df = pd.DataFrame({'id': test_df['id'], 'price': predictions})
        # submission_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
        ```

## Expected Results
-   A trained machine learning model capable of forecasting the cryptocurrency's price.
-   Performance metrics (e.g., "Achieved an RMSE of X on the validation set for predicting the price").
-   A `submission.csv` file with predictions for the test set, formatted as per `sample_submission.csv`.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an approach to predicting cryptocurrency prices using historical data. While the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets makes precise prediction extremely challenging, the models developed can serve as a basis for understanding price dynamics and exploring forecasting techniques. Future work could involve incorporating external factors (if available), trying more complex model architectures, or ensemble methods.
